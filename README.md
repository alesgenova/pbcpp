# PBC++

[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/ales.genova/pbcpp/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/ales.genova/pbcpp/commits/master)

`PBC++` is a C++ library providing some useful abstractions to deal with
molecules and materials under periodic boundary conditions (PBC).

This is a partial conversion of my Python package `PbcPy`, which can be found on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/ales.genova/pbcpy/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/alesgenova/pbcpy) (mirror).
